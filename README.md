# Hangman
## Description
 - Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
 - This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
 - I've learned about classes; creating and initialzing them, writing functions and if statements, Calling functions and methods and OOP.

## How to Install
- Clone the repository and select the hangman folder. The code and contents of the final game is located in the file 'milestone_5.py'. Use the command 'python3 milestone_5.py' to play the game.
